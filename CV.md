## Summary

*I am a BSUIR third year student. I have always interested in computers, and spent a lot of time with them. My uncle and ant are programmers and from an early age I wished to became a programmer. It's amazing to create some tools that are helpful and fun. I studied by myself such programming languages as C, C++, a lot of C#, even more Python. Now, I want to became a full-stack, because it's cool. One person can create and run something in internet by him selve. I found that - it isn't easy way, but the most interesting.*

From codewars (4 kyu):
- def solution(string,markers): 
	    ----new_string = str() 
		----block = False
	    ----for s in string:
		        --------if s == '\n': 
			    ------------block = False 
			    ------------new_string = new_string.strip(' ')
		        --------if s in markers:
			    ------------block = True 
		        --------if block:  
			    ------------continue  
		        --------new_string += s 
	----return  new_string.rstrip(' ')
