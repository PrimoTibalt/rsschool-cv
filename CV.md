## Summary

*I am a BSUIR third year student. I have always interested in computers, and spent a lot of time with them. My uncle and ant are programmers and from an early age I wished to became a programmer. It's amazing to create some tools that are helpful and fun. I studied by myself such programming languages as C, C++, a lot of C#, even more Python. Now, I want to became a full-stack, because it's cool. One person can create and run something in internet by him selve. I found that - it isn't easy way, but the most interesting.*
