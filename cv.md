## Summary

*I am a third year student in  BSUIR. I have been always interested in computers, and spent a lot of time with them. My uncle and aunt are programmers and from an early age I wished to became a programmer. It's amazing to create some tools that are helpful and fun. I studied by myself such programming languages as C, C++, a lot of C# and Python. Now, I want to became a full-stack someday, but at first want to be gentle with backend. Programming keeps a lot of clever people and it's cool to comunicate with them it feels good. When you are a programmer - you are in front of inovations. If you are not - you aren't a programmer!*
